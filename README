jack_play_and_record - Play back a file, and simultaneously record using JACK.

Written by Christian Vogel <vogelchr@vogel.cx> in 2015. This program
is placed in the public domain to the largest extent possible, I do
not claim any rights to this code.

To perform measurements on audio circuits, I want to play back a wav file
(e.g. a sweep tone) and simultaneously record. This small utility does precisely
that. It's not very pretty, but it works.

This invocation will play back the sweep.wav on the first physical
output port on the JACK daemon, and will record one channel from the first
physical input port present on the JACK deamon.

It will wait 96000 samples before it starts playing/recording.

$ ./jack_play_and_record sweep.wav record.wav
Loaded 576000 samples from sweep.wav.
Current sample rate is 48000 Hz.

Currently it doesn't exit cleanly and the jack daemon will complain about
overruns. Just ignore it. :-).
